\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this project, optimal control with and without feedback was implemented on the following in-flight measures of the helicopter under control:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Pitch/Travel 
    \item  Pitch/Travel and Elevation 
\end{itemize}

The results from this optimization in both cases strongly suggest that the helicopter is controlled better with feedback than without, according to the goal of travelling from $\lambda = \pi $ to $\lambda = 0$. The feedback-less control would have fared somewhat better with a more elaborate and accurate model, ideally taking into account noise as well. The model based errors were somewhat counteracted through feedback, as well as noise such as random winds from surrounding airspace.
The model error because of the dependencies between the angles were one of the most dominant errors, such that it was difficult to have both pitch and travel the optimal planned path.  

During this project we gained practice in formulating a dynamic optimization problem, as well as discretizing and solving the resulting problem using a computer. We gained experience with the implementation and practical use of optimal control with and without feedback.
