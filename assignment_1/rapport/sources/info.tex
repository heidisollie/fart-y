\todo{REWRITE}

This is our answers and results for Assignment 1. This is not as much a report as it is an results and discussion text. We have thus not focused that much on  presentation standards and conventions. More on the fact that you as a reader will be able to understand what we have done, what our results were and what we have been able to conclude from them.
