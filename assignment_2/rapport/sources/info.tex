\todo{REWRITE}

This is only a short template for the assignments and it is definitely not necessary to use this template if you are familiar with \LaTeX{} beforehand. The best way to learn \LaTeX{} is to write some stuff yourself and Google problems you run into. Therefore, we will not answer \LaTeX{} related questions outside of the assignment guidance, but you are of course welcome to ask questions then.
